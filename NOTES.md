This file notes the typical things RiseVision does to the outputted code.

- <body style="width:100%;height:100%; margin: 0; overflow: hidden;"> should have a "width: 100%, height: 100%" for inline styling. The size is then copied to the parent iframe.
- Displays running the same schedule with the same presentation has no way to make the animations in sync
